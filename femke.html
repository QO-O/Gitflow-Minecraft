            <h2>Script Mods</h2>
            <p>Script mods, 
                although they are rarely referred to by this and instead simply 'mods',
                are modifications to the game that edits a lot of things. Heavy code,
                adding new items, mobs, functions or gameplay.</p>
            <p>Very common examples of this include 'Farmer's Delight', 
                    a mod which overhauls cooking, farming and food in general. 
                    It adds new foods, new blocks to cook on or cut things with, new recipes, and a lot more.</p>
            <p>Another very popular mod is the Create Mod, 
                a steampunk automation mod that includes a whole load of lag inducing contraptions.</p>
            <p>Mods also have the issue of needing a modloader to work. 
                Minecraft's basegame is not capable of recognising mods, so there are third-party programs that do that instead.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="DataPacks">
            <h2>Data Packs</h2>
            <p>Data Packs are basically mods lite, they can edit within parametres and are less heavy. 
                And one bonus of data packs is that do not need a modloader to work; 
                they can be inserted into the game manually. 
                However there are mods that load datapacks automatically so you don't have to manually do it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ResourcePacks"><h2>Resource Packs</h2>
            <p>Resource packs are the last item commonly called a Minecraft mod, 
                and they are the weakest in capability. 
                They can change block, item or model appearances, 
                but cannot actually change the model, only appearance. 
                However resourcepacks aren't counted as "true mods" sometimes, 
                meaning that even people who play otherwise vanilla would download these, 
                as they do not change mechanics or gameplay at all, only aesthetics.</p>
